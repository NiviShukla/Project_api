# ProjectAPI - Learning RESTful API with Django

Welcome to ProjectAPI! This project serves as a practical guide for learning the fundamentals of building RESTful APIs using Django. In this hands-on exercise, we'll focus on the four essential HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources through an API.
